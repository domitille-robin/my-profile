 			<h1>Hello, I'm Domitille 🤩</h1>

 			<p>
 				I am in my first year at EMLV, at Léonard de Vinci. I am studying marketing, management and finance. My apprenticeship is also very much based on digital, which is very good because tomorrow's professions will all be digital-based. Here is the link to Louise's blog aka My Better Self. She is an influencer that I like to follow because she helps people to have self-confidence. Besides, she loves food as much as I do. 😁

 			<h2>Cook 🍪</h2>
 			<p>
 				I love to cook and test new recipes. Cooking allows me to think about something other than everyday problems, it's a good way to de-stress.

 			<h2>Travelling 🏞</h2>
 			<p> 
 				I love to travel to visit new places, to discover new cultures, to make beautiful encounters. Travelling allows me to be more open-minded.
